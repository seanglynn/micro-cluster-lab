>> This issue occurs when the total memory required to run a spark executor in a container 
(Spark executor memory -> spark.executor.memory + Spark executor memory overhead: spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead) 
exceeds the memory available for running containers on the NodeManager (yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb) node.
